# Integration test: bundled dependencies

*ATTENTION*: this demo might use known vulnerable dependencies for showcasing purposes.

Install [bundled packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json#bundleddependencies)
and see how they behave.  
They can be caused via deprecated `bundleDependencies` or new `bundledDependencies`.
Values can be `true` to mark all dependencies as bundled,
or a list of `string` that identifies the keys in dependencies-lists.

The package [`bundle-dependencies`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bundle-dependencies)
ships with bundled version of `yargs`.

This package itself has a bundled dependency, whcih can be tested with `npm pack`.

## remarks

* In *npm6* the `_inBundle` property is set to `true` in a dependency
* In *npm8* the  `inBundle` property is set to `true` in a dependency.
* Additionally, there is the property `bundleDependencies`(deprecated)/`bundledDependencies` in a component.  
  Value might be `true`(all), `false`(none), or a list of `string` that point to the keys in dependency list.  
* Only one `resolved` can be found, since al the other packages were bundled, and are therefore not resolve.
* Some package managers add a "dist" section to the bundled dependencies - which can be evaluated.
