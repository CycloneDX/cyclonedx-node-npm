## 2.1.0 - 2025-03-19

* Added
  * Functionality for workspaces ([#1126] via [#1212])  
    This introduces new CLI options/switches: `--workspace`, `--no-workspaces`, `--[no-]include-workspace-root`.
    See the docs for details.

[#1212]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-npm/pull/1212

## 2.0.0 - 2025-01-27

* BREAKING Changes
  * CLI option `--spec-version` defaults to `1.6`, was `1.4` ([#1173] via [#1258]) 
  * Emit `$.metadata.tools` as components ([#1233] via [#1235])  
    This affects only CycloneDX spec-version 1.5 and later.
  * Emitted `.purl` values might be partially url-encoded (via [#1235])  
    This is caused by changes on underlying 3rd-party dependency `packageurl-js`.
  * Create dir for output file if not exists ([#1241] via [#1242])  
    This is only a breaking change if you relied on non-existent result paths to cause errors.
* Misc
  * Raised dependency `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library@^7.0.0`, was `@^6.11.0` (via [#1235])

* Added
  * Official support for `npm@11` ([#1245] via [#1249])
  * Capability to gather license text evidences ([#256] via [#1243])

    This feature is experimental. This feature is disabled per default.
* Dependencies
  * No longer directly depend on `packageurl-js` (via [#1237])
* Build
  * Use _TypeScript_ `v5.7.3` now, was `v5.5.3` (via [#1209], [#1218], [#1255])

* Changed
  * Log output is less verbose, can be re-enabled via CLI switch `--verbose` ([#158] via [#1131])

[#1125]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-npm/pull/1125

## 1.14.2 - 2023-11-06

* Fixed
  * SBOM results might have the `externalReferences[].hashes` populated ([#1118] via [#1120])  
    The hashes might have wrongly appeared as `components[].hashes` before.
  * Components' distribution integrity hash of "sha256" is properly detected and populated in the SBOM result ([#699] via [#1121])

## 1.12.0 - 2023-05-17

Based on [OWASP Software Component Verification Standard for Software Bill of Materials](https://scvs.owasp.org/scvs/v2-software-bill-of-materials/)
(SCVS SBOM) criteria, this tool is now capable of producing SBOM documents almost passing Level-2 (only signing needs to be done externally).  
Affective changes based on these SCVS SBOM criteria:
* 2.15 — SPDX license expression detection improved (via [#726])
* 2.18 — SHA-1 integrity hash detection added ([#699] via [#735])

Details
* Changes
  * SPDX license expression detection improved (via [#726])  
    Previously, some expressions were not properly detected, so they were marked as named-license in the SBOM results.
    They should be marked as expression, now.
* Added
  * Added detection for package integrity with SHA-1 ([#699] via [#735])
* Dependencies
  * Raised dependency `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library@^2.0.0`, was `@^1.14.0` (via [#726])

[#735]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-npm/pull/735

## 1.11.0 - 2023-04-27

* Added
  * SBOM result might be validated (via [#660])  
    This feature is enabled per default and can be disabled via CLI switch `--no-validate`.  
    Validation is skipped, if requirements are not met.
    Requires [transitive optional dependencies](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-javascript-library/blob/main/README.md#optional-dependencies)  

[#660]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-npm/pull/660

## 1.10.0 - 2023-04-17

* Added
  * SBOM result might have `component.scope=optional` populated for OptionalDependencies ([#645] via [#657])  
* Fixed
  * DevDependencies that are also required by OptionalDependencies correctly have the property [`cdx:npm:package:development`](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-property-taxonomy/blob/main/cdx/npm.md) populated in SBOM results ([#645] via [#657])
  * DevDependencies that are also required by OptionalDependencies are correctly omitted from SBOM results, when the CLI switch for omitting "dev" and "optional" are set ([#645] via [#657])
* Docs
  * Describe internal NPM executable detection in README (via [#647])
* Build
  * Use _TypeScript_ `v5.0.4` now, was `v4.9.5` (via [#638])

## 1.9.2 - 2023-03-30

* Fixed
  * No longer omit components' version's buildID ([#551] via [#597])  
    Fixed for NPM>=7 only. NPM6 omits this information in the first place, still.
* Misc
  * Utilize SerialNumber generator from [`@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library@^1.13`](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-javascript-library/releases/tag/v1.13.0) (via [#599])  
    The previously used _internal_ code was donated to that library.

    This might increase the quality of SBOM results.
