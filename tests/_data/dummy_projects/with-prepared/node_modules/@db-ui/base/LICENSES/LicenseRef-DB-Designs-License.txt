All Deutsche Bahn AG (hereinafter “DB”) specific design assets like fonts, icons,
trademarks, brandings, etc. (hereinafter “DB Designs”) are licensed under the following
license agreement (the “DB Designs License”):

-   The DB Designs may only be used by external users who are acting as contractors or
    service providers for DB or a group company by virtue of a contractual relationship and
    use the DB Designs in this context ("User"). A license agreement with third parties who
    are not in a contractual relationship with DB or a group company is not possible.
-   DB is and remains the owner or holds the exclusive usage rights to the DB Designs.
    DB grants the User a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable
    right, limited geographically, temporally, and in content to the duration and purposes
    of the contractual relationship with DB or a group company, to use the DB Designs in
    accordance with this license agreement.
-   The User may use the DB Designs only in connection with or for the fulfillment of
    orders and/or services that they provide for DB or a group company. Any other use,
    particularly for private personal purposes or for unauthorized third parties, is
    prohibited. The User may not sublicense, distribute, or otherwise make the DB Designs
    accessible to third parties who are not part of DB AG or a group company, unless this
    is expressly permitted by the underlying contractual relationship between the User and
    DB or the group company. The User may not modify, alter, convert, edit, reverse engineer,
    or decompile the DB Designs; in particular, they may not make any graphical changes
    and/or alter, remove, or add technical functions. Editing or using the DB Designs in
    an altered form is only permitted with the express prior written consent of DB.
-   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, DB provides the DB Designs
    on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of title,
    non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. DB is only liable
    in cases of intent or gross negligence, within the framework of mandatory statutory
    liability provisions, particularly the Product Liability Act, as well as for damages
    arising from injury to life, body, or health of individuals. In cases of gross negligence,
    liability is limited to typical and foreseeable damages. This limitation of liability also
    applies in favor of group companies as well as in favor of vicarious agents of DB and
    its group companies.
-   This DB Designs License automatically ends at the time when the underlying contractual
    relationship between the user and DB or a group company ends. DB may terminate this
    DB Designs License at any time without notice for good cause, in particular, if the User
    violates this DB Designs License and does not cease the violation within a reasonable
    period after a warning. The User is obligated to cease using the DB Designs immediately
    upon termination of this DB Designs License and to delete all DB Designs and related files
    in their possession or installed on their systems, as well as any backup copies, without delay.
-   If any provision of this agreement is or becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
    provisions of this agreement shall remain unaffected. In place of the invalid or unenforceable
    provision, a provision shall be deemed agreed upon that comes closest to the economic purpose
    of the invalid or unenforceable provision in a legally permissible manner. The same applies in
    the event of a gap in the agreement. This DB Designs License is governed by and construed in
    accordance with the laws of Germany, excluding conflicts of law rules and principles.
